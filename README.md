We are going to replace the non-WordPress portion of the website with a React front end and a C# back end (possibly via Lambdas on AWS).
1. We need to decide how we want to deploy and host.  Hopefully something with an automated deploy so we don't need to give all developers admin rights to deploy.
2. * Possibly AWS Lightsail.
   * Possibly https://buddy.works
   * Possibly Vercel: https://vercel.com/
3. We are using github projects to track the coding to do list: https://github.com/orgs/codeforkansascity/projects/1

I think software development projects might benefit from two separate todo lists.  One for project management stuff, the other for code features.

Here is some project management stuff to do (some already done):
| Task            | Who             | Details         | Status  |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Create github repository | Paul    | Named Reusefull-react    | done |
| - Make Rob an Admin | Paul    |     | done |
| Invite people to slack channel | Rob    |     | in progress |
| Add people to slack channel | Paul    |     | in progress |
| Choose architecture | Rob    |     | React and C# Backend |
| Document architecture | Rob    |     |  |
| Create initial react site | Rob    |     |  |
| Create initial C# site | Rob    |     |  |
| Create a Project in Github | Rob    |     |  |
| Document architecture | Rob    |     |  |
