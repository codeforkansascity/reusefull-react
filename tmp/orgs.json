An Oxford House is a democratically run, self-supporting, and drug-free home, where each house is an effective and low-cost method of preventing relapse.

Friends of Recovery gives a monthly New Member Orientation and hosts workshops with house and chapter officers, communication, Oxford House model training, and trauma-informed care. Friends of Recovery is the liaison between Oxford House Inc and the Kansas Oxford Houses.\nOxford House is a concept and operation system for a person with a history of alcohol and substance use to have a realistic chance to get comfortable enough to stay alcohol and substance-free forever. For the person new in recovery, such behavior change takes an opportunity, motivation, time, and peer support. The Oxford House self-run system of operations replaces hopelessness with hope and failure with success.
